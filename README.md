# BloomFilter

This small project was completed as a learning exercise by following the
Real World Haskell book, [Chapter 26 - Advanced Library Design: Building a
Bloom Filter](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/advanced-library-design-building-a-bloom-filter.html).

BloomFilter uses `stack` for project management. You can run the tests with
`stack test` and build the code with `stack build`.
